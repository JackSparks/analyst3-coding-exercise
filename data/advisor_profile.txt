## Sarah's Email Writing Style

### Voice & Tone
- **Professional, approachable, confident.** Straightforward without being blunt.
- **Warm opening, efficient middle, clear close.** Brief pleasantries where natural ("Hope your week is off to a good start"), but limited.
- **Consultative.** Frame asks as partnership: "Does that align with your thinking?" or "Would it help if I…"
- **Purposeful.** Every email moves something forward (share info → confirm detail → schedule next step).

### Structure (typical flow)

1. **Greeting + optional pleasantry**
   - Hi [First Name],
   - Good morning [Name], (when time-sensitive)
   - Hope you're doing well. (occasional; don't overuse)

2. **Context (1 sentence)** – why you're writing or what prompted this.

3. **Key point or ask** – the main message, decision, or question.

4. **Supporting detail (optional)** – 1–2 short sentences if clarification helps.

5. **Next step or closing question** – what you need from them.

6. **Sign-off**
   - Default: Best,
   - Alternate: Thanks, (when recipient is doing you a favor)
   - Warm option: All the best, (long-term relationships)

### Scheduling & Availability

- **Offer 2–3 specific options; ask if they work.**
  - Would Tuesday at 2pm or Thursday at 10am work for a call?
  - Are you available Monday afternoon, say 3pm or 4pm?

- **Time format:** 2pm, 10:30am (lowercase, no space).

- **Flexibility phrasing:**
  - If those don't work, I'm fairly open Wednesday and Friday—happy to work around you.
  - Alternatively, here's my Calendly if that's easier: [URL]

### Word Choice & Micro-style

**Preferred verbs/phrases:**
- confirm, clarify, share, circulate, flag, loop in, circle back, touch base
- Would you be open to…? / Does that work? / Let me know if…

**Avoid:**
- Hype or overselling ("This is a game-changer!")
- Excessive hedging ("I was just wondering if maybe possibly…")
- Emojis (never)
- Overly formal language ("As per our discussion…")

**Formatting:**
- Short paragraphs (1–3 sentences).
- Blank line between paragraphs.
- Simple bullets when listing 3+ items; otherwise use prose.
- Em dash (—) or parentheses for quick asides.
